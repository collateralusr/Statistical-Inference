# Simulation Exercise for the Exponential Distribution
## Author: Edward Lau

### Overview: I am going to report on a simulation exercise and inferential data analysis. The first part will examine how the exponential distribution behaves under simulation. The second part will analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R dataset package.

### Part 1: Exponential distribution simulation

The following code will do 1000 simulations of random exponential distribution with lambda = 0.2 and 40 observations. It will then get the means and variances of those 1000 simulations.
```{r}
set.seed(100)
sim <- 1000
means = NULL
vars = NULL
for (i in 1: sim){
        means <- c(means, mean(rexp(40,0.2)))
        vars <- c(vars, var(rexp(40,0.2)))
        }
```

The histogram of the simulation result is below:
```{r}
hist(means)
```

###Question 1: The mean of the simulated values:
```{r}
mean(means)
```
which compares quite well to the theoretical value of 1/0.2 = 5.

###Question 2: The standard deviation of the distribution:
```{r}
hist(vars^0.5)
mean(vars^0.5)
```
Hence the variance of the simulation is about (1/0.2)^2 ~ 25; and the standard deviation ~5, which compares quite well to the theoretical value of 1/0.2 = 5.

###Question 3: Normal distribution?
```{r}
quantile(means)
quantile(rnorm(1000,mean=mean(means), sd=sd(means)))
```
It seems like the quantiles of the two distributions are quite comparable...
